                <h1>Equipment</h1>
                <p>I have an odd mix of old and new for my current equipment: a preamp that I bought in 2016 paired with the record player my dad gave me from 1977. Despite its age, the record player works exceptionally well, and I hope to use it for as long as I can, even if it’s not the prettiest or even close to being modern. The great thing about audio equipment is that, with how audio works, a lot of extremely old equipment will still be relevant, and in some cases outshine modern hardware.</p>
                <br>
                <p>There’s a bit of an issue with modern hardware as well, since a lot of companies are trying to cash-in on record collecting as a trend. We’ve all seen those suitcase-style portable turntables at big-box stores, and they come with plenty of problems. Meant to be used more as a showpiece than an actual piece of hardware, there’s many products that are cheaply made, and sold almost entirely on looks alone. Not to say that all modern hardware is bad though. Audio Technica has many extremely good record players at decent prices, allowing a good starting point for any budding enthusiasts. There’s also very high-end turntables that are a mix between aesthetics and performance, and can sometimes run up to $500 or more in price. For anyone interested though, my advice would be to go to a local record store (if available) and get advice from people who are passionate about it. If unavailable, online message boards can offer some indispensable insight.</p>
