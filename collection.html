                    <p>The first glass beach album by glass beach came out May 18th, 2019, and has already become one of my favorite albums of all time easily. It's such a unique blend of styles, it only makes sense that the pressing of their album would be just as wonderful to look at. I have a limited-to-100 first pressing, the A/B disc deep blue while the C/D disc is a nice, dark violet. It also features some of the most beaufitul art I've seen on any gatefold I own. <br><a href="https://glassbeach.bandcamp.com/album/the-first-glass-beach-album">Link to album &rarr;</a></p>

                    <p>Floral EP by Floral is, unsurprisingly, a combination of the first and second EPs by the band Floral. They have a unique sound, and this is the only one-of-a-kind press I own. Originally, I had ordered another pressing (that one only limited to 30!), but it was lost in post, so after talking to the merch distributor, they said they could send me a failed press. Originally, the design was supposed to be clear with the red and blue splatter, but the version I got is transluscent red. <br><a href="https://floral1.bandcamp.com/album/floral-ep">Link to album &rarr;</a></p>

                    <p>still by Nouns is one of the most surprising albums I've ever heard. Not many works of art contain so much raw emotion, and I felt it was very fitting when I found a test pressing of this album for sale. The idea of owning a low-fi album by a bunch of college-age kids in an "imperfect" format is wonderful to me. The album already exudes such raw emotion and sound, being able to experience that in an even more raw form is something special. <br><a href="https://nounss.bandcamp.com/album/still">Link to album &rarr;</a></p>

                    <p>Take Offs and Landings by Rilo Kiley is a much different sound from most of my collection, but it's an album I listened to heavily when I started college, and I always love going back to it. The record is special to me, because it has this lovely design etched into the D-side, showing four rats in a circle around the center. On the outside of this disc is a hidden track, one of my favorites on the entire album. Using the medium itself to add more art to completed works is such a neat way to utilize it. <br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Take-Offs-Landings-Rilo-Kiley/dp/B004P4CPF0/ref=tmm_vnl_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=">Link to album &rarr;</a></p>
